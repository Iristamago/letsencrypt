PyInstaller setup for Let's Encrypt client.

Works with:
- cryptography 1.0
- pyinstaller 9d0e0ad4c1c02964bbff86edbf7400cd40958b1a (v2.1 does NOT work)

You can create the binaries by running:

  make clean all

One-file output binary is in ./dist/letsencrypt, one-folder is in
./dist/folder. You can quickly test it both by running:

  ./test.sh -a manual auth
