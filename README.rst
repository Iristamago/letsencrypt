About the Let's Encrypt Client
==============================

|build-status| |coverage| |docs|

In short: getting and installing SSL/TLS certificates made easy (`watch demo video`_).

The Let's Encrypt Client is a tool to automatically receive and install
X.509 certificates to enable TLS on servers. The client will
interoperate with the Let's Encrypt CA which will be issuing browser-trusted
certificates for free beginning the summer of 2015.

It's all automated:

* The tool will prove domain control to the CA and submit a CSR (Certificate
  Signing Request).
* If domain control has been proven, a certificate will get issued and the tool
  will automatically install it.

All you need to do is:

::

   user@www:~$ sudo letsencrypt -d www.example.org


**Encrypt ALL the things!**

This is a **DEVELOPER PREVIEW** intended for developers and testers only.

**DO NOT RUN THIS CODE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER. IT WILL INSTALL CERTIFICATES
SIGNED BY A TEST CA, AND WILL CAUSE CERT WARNINGS FOR USERS.**
